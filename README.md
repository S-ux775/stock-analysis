# stock-analysis

** Overwiew of Project

Analyse the performance of stocks over a two year time frame (2017, 2018).

Based on a dataset (green_stocks), code is written to perform analysis of relevant stock. Refactoring allow us to verify an improve the performance of initial script.

** Results

 AllStockAnalysis() and refactored AllStockAnalysis() is run with time reduction while keeping values intact (%Return). 

** Summary
    Refactoring can lead to scrip easier to read that at times can improve performance (run time). I could also mean shorter script. 

    A possible disadvante (if not performed correctly) can introduce errors difficult to trace and debug.

    For this excersise, refactoring showed improved run time for both 2017 and 2018.
